They also planned to add fairy lights around the photo booth, ensure enough props are available, and use a heart-shaped backdrop for the photos to create a whimsical and unforgettable atmosphere for the guests. Pepper Robot suggested adding fairy lights around the entrance to create a magical ambiance for the guests, which Isabella agreed to and planned to strategically place them. Pepper also offered to help with the entertainment setup, specifically checking the sound system and ensuring the playlist was ready, while Isabella would handle the performers. @ <persona> Isabella Rodriguez",
